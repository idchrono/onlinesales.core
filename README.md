## Getting started

<a id="overview-solution-structure"></a>
### Overview of the Solution Structure

* `OnlineSales` located at /src/OnlineSales folder is the core project which consists of reusable core functionalities described in [Project Overview](#overview).

* `OnlineSales.Tests` located at /tests/OnlineSales.Tests folder is the project which consists of automated unit and integration test suite for `OnlineSales` core project.

* `docker-compose` folder contains the .yml files to spin up docker containers to provide database and logging services for development and testing environments.

* `plugins` folder contains a set of projects which can be plugged into core project via a common interface at the runtime.
    * All the generic functionalities are implemented in the core project, while specific requirements are implemented as separate projects which can be plugged into core project.

<a id="prerequisites"></a>
### Pre-requisites for development environment setup

1. Install docker desktop for windows
    * Download [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

    * Prerequisites for docker installation:
        * `CPU virtualization` should be enabled in BIOS settings.
        * `Hyper-V` and `Containers` windows features should be enabled.

2. Install [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

3. Install/Upgrade Visual Studio IDE.
    - Visual Studio Version should be `2022 17.4` or higher, which supports .NET 7

4. Install [CLI tools for Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet).

<a id="setup-docker-containers"></a>
### Setting up docker containers

OnlineSales platform integrates with two databases initially.
1. PostgreSQL
2. Elastic

* Docker containers should be created to run database services for development and testing environments.

#### Setting up docker containers to run automated test suite.

1. Navigate to `docker-compose` folder in the solution.

2. Open `docker-compose.tests.yml` docker file and update if necessary.

3. Open a command line tool in the same folder location.

4. Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.tests.yml up` command.

5. Open docker desktop and verify Postgres and Elastic containers are up and running.

#### Setting up docker containers for development environment

1. Navigate to `docker-compose` folder in the solution.

2. Open `docker-compose.develop.yml` docker file and update if necessary.

3. Open a command line tool in the same folder location.

4. Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.develop.yml up` command.

5. Open docker desktop and verify Postgres and Elastic containers are up and running.

<a id="secrets-management"></a>
### Secrets management

Any secrets such as user credentials should not be stored in appsettings.json file.
- Ex: Do not store `Password` for `Postgres` and `Elastic` sections of appsettings.json file.

Secrets of the appsettings.json file should hold placeholders for environment variables.
- Ex:
```
"Email": {
    "Server": "$EMAIL__SERVER",
    "UserName": "$EMAIL__USERNAME",
    "Password": "$EMAIL__PASSWORD"
  }
```
* Note the format of the placeholder: Nested configuration keys are combined with a double underscore and written in capital letters.
    - Ex: Configuration key `Email:Server` should be written as `$EMAIL__SERVER`

#### Updating appsettings secrets in local environment

Visual Studio in-built [Secret Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows#secret-manager) tool can be used to manage all secrets in local development environment.

It will maintain a `secrets.json` file internally to store any configuration.

`secret.json` file will not be version controlled by default.

* In Visual Studio, by default Secret Manager can be accessed from UI.

* For Visual Studio Code, to enable it from UI, "Manage User Secrets" extension can be used.

* For any tool, Secret Manager can be used with dotnet commands

##### How to use `Secret Manager` feature in Visual Studio:

1. Right-click on `OnlineSales` project and click on `Manage User Secrets`.

2. Update the `secrets.json` file with required secrets in the format same as the `appsettings.json` file.

Secrets of the `appsettings.tests.json` file can also be managed using Secret Manager in the test project.

At runtime, secrets of `appsettings.json` file (or appsettings.tests.json) will be replaced by the values of `secrets.json`.

#### Updating appsettings secrets in pipeline

Secrets are stored as `Variables` in the pipeline and can be marked as secrets.

Pipeline variables should be assigned to Environment variables in the pipeline script.

At pipeline runtime, secrets of `appsettings.json` file (or appsettings.unittest.json) will be replaced by the corresponding environment variables.

### Debugging the project in local environment

1. Make sure above pre-requisites and configuration settings are completed.

2. Run the project from toolbar

3. Verify whether the swagger documentation is opened in the default browser window.

<a id="run-test-project"></a>
### Running automated test suite

1. Locate the project `OnlineSales.Tests`.

2. Locate `appsettings.tests.json` file and verify the database credentials.
    * Configurations available in `appsettings.tests.json` file will replace the same configurations in `appsettings.json` file at run time.
    * Refer [Secrets Management](#secrets-management) for more details on storing credentials.

3. Right-click on the project and click on `Run Tests` or `Debug Tests`.

<a id="working-with-migrations"></a>
### Working with Database Migrations

* Database will be created automatically using generated migration scripts when starting the application.
    * Application will first apply the migrations of core project followed by migrations of plugin projects

* However, migrations can be applied manually if need using [entity framework core commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet#using-the-tools) in a command line interface or package manager console.

* When a model is updated, a new migration script should be generated to update the database using [entity framework core commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet#using-the-tools) following the existing naming conventions.

<a id="plugin-integration"></a>
## Plugin integration

* `OnlineSales` core project provides more generic and reusable functionalities, while a plugin project can be implemented to cater more specific requirements that may be provided by different clients.

* Core project can be published and run as a CMS without integrating any plugin, but a plugin requires the core project to be up and running.

* A plugin is connected to core project via a common interface called `IPlugin`.
    * Plugin should be inherited from `IPlugin` interface so that the core project can load all supported plugins at the application startup.

    * Any plugin-level configurations should be added to a file named `pluginsettings.json` within the plugin project, which is getting merged with `appsettings.json`.

    * Plugin loading is enabled by adding the plugin directory name to 'Plugins' section of 'appsettings.json' file
    
    * `PluginManager` class of the core project is responsible for loading all supported plugins and merging configurations into `appsettings.json`

    * `Program` class of the core project initiates the `PluginManager` at the application startup.

* Core project should be added as a dependency for a plugin project either as a project reference or nuget package reference so that the plugin can access interfaces and public classes for integrations.

* A plugin can also add new models and migrations with data seeding on top of core database structure.

* Example use cases for plugin integration:
    * `Email service` is a generic functionality of the core project and a plugin can implement a `Contact Us` form where it uses core email service to send email notifications.
    * `Scheduled task runner` is a generic functionality of the core project and a plugin can provide user-specific data, such as schedules, email templates, etc.. as input data to run scheduled tasks.


<a id="default-plugin"></a>
### Default plugins

`OnlineSales` solution consists of a set of plugins that are already implemented.
* `OnlineSales.Plugin.AzureAD` :

* `OnlineSales.Plugin.Email` : Implementation of a generic email service that can be configured to use any email service provider which supports SMTP protocol.

* `OnlineSales.Plugin.Sms` : Implementation of a generic sms service configured to use sms gateways such as Amazon SNS, ShoutOut, NotifyLK.

* `OnlineSales.Plugin.Vsto` :


<a id="new-plugin"></a>
### Adding a new plugin

1. Create a new class library project.
    * Project can be added to the `OnlineSales` solution or to a new solution depending on the requirement.

2. Add `OnlineSales` core project as a dependency.
    * If the new project is added to the `OnlineSales` solution, the dependency can be added as a project reference.

    * If the project is added to a new solution, `OnlineSales` project dependency can be added as a nuget package reference.

3. Add a new class inherited from `IPlugin` interface, which comes under `OnlineSales.Interfaces` namespace.

4. Implement a new service based on the requirement and register it in the application's service collection.

5. Use the `ConfigureServices` method of the `IPlugin` interface to register a dependency service into the [DI container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-7.0) of the core application.
    * `IServiceCollection` parameter represents the list of services that the application depends on. Any plugin-level dependency service should be added to this collection.
        * Example:
            ```c#
            services.AddSingleton<IEmailService, EmailService>();
            ```
    * `IConfiguration` can be used to access all the configurations available in `appsettings.json`.

6. To make plugin loading enabled add the plugin directory name to 'Plugins' section of 'appsettings.json' file
    * Example
        ```
        "Plugins": [ "OnlineSales.Plugin.AzureAD", "OnlineSales.Plugin.Email" ],
        ```

7. To make plugin loading disabled remove the plugin directory name from 'Plugins' section of 'appsettings.json' file
    

<a id="plugin-migrations"></a>
### Plugin-level migrations

To extend the core project's database context, use the `PluginDbContextBase` abstract database context class that comes under `OnlineSales.Data` namespace, which inherited from the `PgDbContext` class which is the main database context of the core project.
* Create new models which are specific to the plugin requirement.

* Create a new class inherited from `PluginDbContextBase` class and add `DbSet` type properties which map to database tables, for the newly created entities.

* Override `OnModelCreating` method to seed plugin-level default data into the database.

* Use [entity framework core commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet#using-the-tools) to add a new migration script if a new model is added or perform a data seeding.
    * Note: `--configuration` option with the value `Migration` should be used for plugin-level migrations
        * Example:
            ```
            dotnet ef migrations add "[SampleMigrationName]" --configuration Migration
            ```
* Register the extended database context class in the `ConfigureServices` method.
    * Example:
        ```c#
        services.AddScoped<PluginDbContextBase, ExtendedDbContext>();
        ```
